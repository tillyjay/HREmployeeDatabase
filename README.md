# HREmployeeDatabase

This website is modeled after an HR Employee database. The site includes an authenticated user login to an interface that allows for the viewing, searching, inserting, updating, and deleting of employee records. There is even an opt-in/opt-out of employee benefits and pagination of employee records.

PHP was used to create the site (along with all of the modification capabilities) and connects to a MySQL database. Throughout the site Javascript was used to create forms (such as the user login) with the appropriate client side validation and hashed passwords.

If I were to recreate this site, I would clean up my code by making the information within the JavaScript forms fixed variables and not changeable data fields. This would ensure that updating and deleting functions would always correspond with correct employee number, without room for human error.
